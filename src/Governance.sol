/** @dev Loosely forked from NounsDAOLogicV1.sol (0xa43afe317985726e4e194eb061af77fbcb43f944) with following major modifications:
- add gas refunding for voting and creating proposals
- pack proposal struct into fewer storage slots 
- track votes, proposals created, and proposal passed by user for community score calculation
- track votes, proposals created, and proposal passed across all users counting towards community voting power
- removed tempProposal from the proposal creation process
- added a verification step for new proposals to confirm they passed Snapshot pre-governance
- adjusted roles and permissions
- added an array to track Active Proposals and a clear() function to remove them 
- removed the ability to pass a reason along with a vote, and to vote by EIP-712 signature
- allow the contract to receive Ether (for gas refunds)
